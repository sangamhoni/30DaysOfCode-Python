# OOP  
- oop is made to comply with real world examples  
- two main things that make up an object: its attributes (what is has) and its methods (what it does)  

## Class  
- the class is the main category while the blueprint generated from the class is object  
- Eg: Class-Waiter, Object-Henry, Betty  
- class is mostly written in capital case (pascal case). Eg: CarBlueprint(), Turtle()  

## Object  
- Object is generated from the class  
- object=class()  
- Eg: car=CarBlueprint()  

## Attributes  
- just a fancy word for a variable thats associated with a particular modeled object  
- data  
- it is written by: object.attribute  

## Methods  
- just a fancy word for a function thats associated with a particular modeled object  
- functionality  
- written as: object.method()  


# Turtle package  
- its blueprint (class) is turtle and it is called by: object_name = turtle.Turtle()  
- Syntax:  
from turtle import *  

## Classes of turtle:  
### Turtle()  
timmy=turtle.Turtle()  


### Screen()  
my_screen=turtle.Screen()
#### Properties:  
- canvheight  

## Attributes of turtle:  

## Methods of turtle:  
- my_screen.exitonclick()  
- timmy.shape("turtle")  
- timmy.color('coral')
