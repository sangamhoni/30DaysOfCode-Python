## What I learned today:  
- I learned how we can do certain things by getting the keystrokes that the user presses  
- A review on how nested functions work  
- Changing a normal code into OOP to make the code simplier  
- Using global variables on code to make it independent and easily changeable  
- Using multiple objects simultaneously from a single class and managing them  

## Projects I did today:  
- A sketchboard where the user can draw things using the WSAD keys. S/he can also clear the canvas and lift off the pen while working  
- A snake game (incomplete yet) where the user can control the snake according to the keystrokes (using OOP)
