## What I learned today:  
- how while loops and its parameters  
- using function  
- more functions on different modules
- program flow and logic building  
- roadmap development on a project  
- linking different files with each other and using them as a module  

## Projects I did today:  
- For the whole day, I made Hangman game. I added all the restrictions, with 'proper design' and probably made it bug free as far as I could
