## What I learned today:  
- I learned about functions: round(float_num, dec_place)  
- How print(f"...{variable}") works  
- Subscripting - pulling out individual letters from a string  
&nbsp;  
I also learned a bit about git rebase command on how it works, and fixed my .gitignore files which actually took me a lot of time to figure it out  

## Projects I did today:  
- A tip calculator including tip percentage and bill-splits  
- A program to add digits of a 2-digit number, but thru type conversion  
- A program to see if the user fits the criteria to ride a rollercoaster or not  
- A BMI Calculator program which calculates your BMI and tells you which category you fall in
