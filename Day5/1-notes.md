## For Loops  

#### Synatax:  
for n in range(start, end, <step>):  
    print (n)  

it doesnt include the end number though :)  

#### Eg:  
fruits=["apple", "orange", "pear"]  
for fruit in fruits:  
    print(fruit)  

## Notes:  
- You can take input in the form of list using: namelist=input("Input name list here" ).split()
