## What I learned today:  
- How to use local and global variables to keep track of values in a program  
- Use of suitable variables type  
- Setting up IDE  

## Projects I did today:  
- A coffee machine where user can choose which coffee to drink. The computer then checks if the ingredients are enough, and if the user has enough money. If all the requirements are met, then the computer gives user his drink and returns his/her change. The program is also able to show the remaining ingredients and the total earnings entering 'report' in the prompt. The machine can also be turned off by entering 'off' in the prompt.
