## What I learned today:  
- Making a function to provide outputs instead of printing within the function  
- Using functions within another function (nested functions)  
- About docstrings; their usecases and syntax  
- Using functions with dictionaries to reduce redundancy  
- Recursion with its use in a program  

## Projects I did today:  
- A program to count the number of days in a month of a certain year (including leap years)  
- A Calculator app that can do calculations repeatedly by remembering the last value, if necessary
