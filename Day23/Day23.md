## What I learned today:  
- more on turtle graphics with another game building  
1. creating random blocks at random positions  
2. moving them continuously  
3. detection of collision  
and more  

## Projects I did today:  
- A Turtle crossing game where the player controls the turtle and tries to avoid hitting the moving cars (a simple colored block here) and get to the finish line.
